How to play:

To play you must set up a local database. You need to use the following SQL commands, xampp is the recommended program for this:

create database Reaching_Insanity;

use database Reaching_Insanity;

create table player (name char(50), highest_level INTEGER, image_id INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY (name));

create table leaderboard (level INTEGER, name char(50), seconds INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY (level, name), FOREIGN KEY (name) references player (name));



Controls – Use the arrows keys to move the character. Items are used automatically.

Items – These are shown on the left of the screen. You can collect items by stepping onto them. Items are required to walk onto certain tiles and enter doors. Fire boots – Allows you to walk on fire. Ice skates – Allows you to glide on ice. Flippers – Allows you to step onto water tiles. Without these items you die when you enter the tiles.

Doors – Coloured doors require a certain colour key, which is shown by the door colour. 
Token doors require a certain number of tokens to be collected which is shown on the door.

Goal – The goal of the game is to reach the worm hole without dying. If you die the level restarts. Your quickest time for each level, if good enough will be displayed on the leader board.

Enemies - These have various behaviours and some will target you, if they catch you, you die and the level restarts.

Good luck!
